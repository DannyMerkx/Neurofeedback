Welcome to the Imaginery movement training game!

In this game you should help an animal to find their targets. You will see a goat, bunny and 
bird. You should identify the right target and use one imagined movement to help the animal:
- right hand movement;
- left hand movement;
- feet movement.
Please note the guidlines. They show you which movement you should use.
The whole game consists of blocks. We offer you a break beetween them.
